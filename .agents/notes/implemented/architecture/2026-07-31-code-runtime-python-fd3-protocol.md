# Agent Note: the code-runtime-python fd-3 frame protocol

Status: implemented

The private CPython provider lives at `packages/experimental/code-runtime-python`; the shared TypeScript protocol lives in the released `@deepseek-ai/dsh-code-runtime-python-protocol` package under `packages/code-runtime/code-runtime-python-protocol`.

## Problem

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-code-runtime-python-protocol` owns the TypeScript wire protocol used by CPython code-runtime providers. Such a provider runs each model program in a fresh `python3 -I` subprocess and bridges binding calls and completion values over the child's fd 3. The host cannot trust that channel: model code has full access to fd 3 and can forge any frame, so every inbound frame is hostile input that the host must validate and rebuild before reading. The protocol also has to carry lossless JSON without the depth limit `JSON.stringify` and `json.dumps` impose, because the seam's `CodeJsonValue` is depth-unbounded.

The released protocol package contains the host-side frame types, lossless JSON codec, byte meters, and hostile-frame validators. `PythonCodeRuntime`, the `python3 -I` subprocess path, and the Python-side codec remain in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-code-runtime-python`; that package re-exports its previous protocol names from the released owner. The [protocol ownership decision](2026-09-14-code-runtime-python-protocol-ownership.md) defines package placement and compatibility, while this decision remains the authority for wire semantics. The protocol builds on the [portable identifier seam](../../archived/architecture/2026-07-31-code-runtime-portable-identifier-seam.md).

## Decision

`packages/code-runtime/code-runtime-python-protocol/src/index.ts` is the host side of the wire vocabulary and its hostile-frame codec:

- **`validateChildFrame`** shape-validates and REBUILDS every inbound frame. The compile-time union means nothing on fd 3 — a forged frame can carry `null`, poisoned fields, or omit required ones — so each accepted frame is reconstructed field by field: forged extras never ride along, a non-finite call id can never be echoed into a reply, and junk returns `undefined` to be dropped rather than throwing in the host's message handler.
- **`encodeJsonPlain` / `checkDoneValue` / `hasUnsafeIntegerToken` / `hasNonLosslessNumber`** are the lossless-JSON codec and meters. They traverse iteratively (an explicit stack, not recursion) so a deep value below the byte budget crosses intact; `checkDoneValue` folds byte-metering and number-losslessness into one walk that rejects an over-budget payload before the incremental work it would otherwise add — the enqueued children; strings and keys are metered by a non-allocating escaped-size scan (`jsonStringBytesUpTo`), so the escaped copy is never materialized. It does not re-bound the frame's own width: `done.value` is already `JSON.parse`'d when the check runs, so a consuming runtime must cap fd-3 bytes before parsing. Beyond-safe-range integral doubles serialize through `BigInt` digits so the exact integer crosses, not `String()`'s rounded form.
- **`logTruncationMarker`** produces the in-band marker text a log ledger emits when it exhausts its byte budget.

`py/protocol.py` mirrors the message shapes as `TypedDict`s and re-declares the two surfaces both sides EXECUTE against — `PROTOCOL_FD = 3` and `log_truncation_marker` — with byte-identical text.

The released protocol package is independently buildable and has no runtime dependencies. Each provider owns its Python bootstrap and process lifecycle; the experimental provider keeps `py/protocol.py` as the Python declaration mirror.

## Wire contract

Frames are JSON-lines on fd 3, one object per line, leaving stdout/stderr free for the program's own output. Child → host: `boot-ack`, `call`, `log`, `done`. Host → child: `boot` (first frame), `run` (after `boot-ack`), and one `reply` per `call`. The `log` frame's `truncated` flag marks the frame that IS the child ledger's own truncation marker, so the host stops capturing at the same point the child did instead of inferring it from its own budget. The `log` frame's `open` flag marks an unterminated line committed by an explicit flush: the host holds it and appends the next frame to the same entry, so an explicit flush followed by more text reads back as one line rather than a fake newline. The one exception is truncation: when a later over-budget frame trips the ledger, the already-billed prefix is committed as its own entry and the truncation marker follows it (marker last, no re-charge). The merged entry's wire cost is billed exactly once, split incrementally across its fragments on both sides (O(k) for k fragments, never a re-walk of the whole hold): the FIRST fragment pays the full JSON-string cost plus the separator, each continuation and the closing frame pay only their content; the host's exact-cost caps are `logBudget - 1` for a first fragment (the ledger's reserved byte, matching `admit`) and `logBudget + 2` for a continuation or closing frame (billed without the two quotes), and `jsonStringCostUpTo` returns `undefined` below a 2-byte cap; the child keys its split billing off `_open_started` alone, so a closing frame bills as the merged tail. `done.error.kind` is one of `exception`, `invalid-output`, `output-limit`; wall/CPU budgets, aborts, and substrate death are observed host-side, not carried as frames.

## Mirror alignment

`py/protocol.py` and the released protocol package agree that `LogMessage` carries `truncated`, `DoneMessage.error` carries `kind`, and `Namespace` may carry `errorClass`. `tests/protocol-mirror.e2e.ts` spawns a real `python3` and asserts `PROTOCOL_FD`, `log_truncation_marker`, and each `TypedDict`'s required and optional wire field sets against the released protocol package. A renamed or dropped field, or a required/optional mismatch, fails the test. Field *types* are not compared across the language boundary; review and the runtime's real-subprocess suite (`runtime.spec.ts`) own that gap.

## Alternatives considered

**Require a future Python JSON codec (`_encode_json_plain` / `_decode_json_plain`) to live in `py/protocol.py` for cross-side symmetry with the released TypeScript protocol module.** Rejected. The repository's "prefer symmetry for parallel values" rule points at genuinely parallel values; these are not. The host-side codec in the released protocol package validates hostile input and is self-contained. A child-side codec would produce trusted output and belong with bootstrap-owned emission and cost accounting; forcing only its entry points into `protocol.py` would couple the vocabulary mirror to runtime internals or create an import cycle. `protocol.py` remains a pure wire-vocabulary mirror; the codec (`_encode_json_plain` / `_decode_json_plain`) lives in `bootstrap.py` with the runtime it serves.

**Keep the protocol implementation inside the private runtime package.** Rejected: the released data Python provider uses the same host-side vocabulary and validation behavior, and a release member cannot depend on a private package omitted from publication.

## Consequences

Bought: the fd-3 protocol and its hostile-input codec form a released, self-contained, fully unit-covered layer shared by both CPython providers, with an executing guard against TypeScript/Python field-set drift. Provider bootstraps consume the reviewed wire contract without creating a release dependency on a private runtime.

Cost: the mirror e2e compares field names and required/optional status across the two sides but not field types; comparing type declarations across TypeScript and Python has no mechanical equivalent, so review and each provider's real-subprocess suite retain that responsibility. The private provider keeps compatibility re-exports that must track the released protocol package.
